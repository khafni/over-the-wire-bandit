*my solution:
	any cronjab that resides in /etc/cron.d/ will be runed
	so as the "cronjob_bandit24" that just runs the 
	/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh script every minute 
	and that script content gives us a hint which is
	that all scripts that are in the /var/spool/bandit24
	are runned and deleted every 60 seconds

		#!/bin/bash                                                                     
		myname=$(whoami)                                                                        
		cd /var/spool/$myname                                                                   
		echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"                        
		for i in * .*;                                                                          
		do                                                                                      
		    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];                                                 
		    then                                                                                
			echo "Handling $i"                                                              
			timeout -s 9 60 ./$i                                                            
			rm -f ./$i                                                                      
		    fi                                                                                  
		done
	so we can only put a simple script that get use the password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24

		#!/bin/bash
		cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/khafni23/password
	
	in /var/spool/bandit24 and wait for it to get executed and get voila we get the password!

*password for level24:
