*my solution:
	base64 -d data.txt
*Explination:
	the command base64 allows us to encode/decode data and print the output to the standard output	
	knowing data we can use its -d option to decode the data.txt file that is already encoded in base 64
*a little note about base 64 encription:
	Base64 is a way to encode binary data into an ASCII character set known to pretty much every computer system,
	in order to transmit the data without loss or modification of the contents itself. For example, mail systems cannot
	deal with binary data because they expect ASCII (textual) data. So if you want to transfer an image or another file,
	it will get corrupted because of the way it deals with the data.
	Note: base64 encoding is NOT a way of encrypting, nor a way of compacting data. In fact a base64 encoded piece of data
	is 1.333â€¦ times bigger than the original datapiece. It is only a way to be sure that no data is lost or modified during
	the transfer.
