the solution is:
find . -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null | xargs cat
i reached this solution by looking for a solution to the permission denied lines that i get when i use the find command
we used the ownership find options -user and -group to only show files owned by user bandit7 and group bandit6
and we 2>/dev/null to send all error messages to the /dev/null (the black hole of your unix system) so we won't be shown out the permission deniend lines by find
we pipe everything to xargs cat so we can apply cat to lines that find outputs (we have only one line but it could work for the case of multiple lines)
