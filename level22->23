*solution:
	here we only need to read the script that can be easily
	found following the same steps as the previous level
	(kinda)
		#!/bin/bash

		myname=$(whoami)
		mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

		echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

	running the script gives us the following output:
		Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 to /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3
	but we want the password for level23 so we can only change the content of the variable
	myname in the script to bandit23 and execute the script to get:
		Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit23 to /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
	and checking the content of /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349 gives us the password
*password for level 23:
