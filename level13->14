*my solution:
	the only infos that we were given are:
		+localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
		+you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level
	so i thought that i could use the ssh command with -i option to use the
	private ssh key that is given to us to log in an ssh server and use localhost
	 as the hostaddress and it worked!
	then after getting in that local server i found the password for the level14 in
	/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
*command used to connect to the bandit14 server:
	ssh -i sshkey.private -l bandit14 localhost
*password for level 14:
