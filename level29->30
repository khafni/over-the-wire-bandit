*my solution:
	we can find out that when we cat the README that there's
	no password in production but that is only in the master
	branch, not the other branches , so we try to find out
	the content of the other branches, when we try to checkout
	the remotes/origin/dev remote branch we find out that 
	README.md now contains the password!
*commands used:
	git branch -a (to list both remote-tracking branches and local branches)
	git checkout (to switch to another branch)
*password for level30:
	5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf
