*my solution:
	when we are logged as bandit25 and we do a simple 
		cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
	(following the instructions that bandit26 use a different shell than bash we trying
	to  find it out)
	and for real bandit26 uses /usr/bin/showtext as a shell, when we cat into it we find
		#!/bin/sh

		export TERM=linux

		more ~/text.txt
		exit 0	
	which means that so called shell just uses the command more somehow when we trying to
	connect to the ssh server .
	we try to connect to the server it just uses more to show us ~/text.txt file and exits
	because the more commands shows us the whole file and exits if the file/input is smaller than
	the actual terminal window, so all we need to stay in the server is to make our terminal window
	as small as possible before trying to ssh into the server , then we use the v key to enter the default
	editor of our server session which is vim and use its file explorer to get the password of the level
	from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
password for level 26:
