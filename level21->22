*my solution:
	+steps:
		1)cd /etc/cron.d
		2)cat cronjob_bandit22
		3)cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
		4)cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
	cron is a daemon to execute scheduled commands, aka a program
	that keeps running from the start of the system in the backround
	, and it is used to makes routines of running commands/programs
	and we use the /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22 crontab file
	(crontabfile consists of commands, one per line, that execute automatically
	at the time specified by the first five fields at the beginning of
	each command line. These first five fields, described in the following
	table, are separated by spaces. They indicate when the command will be
	executed.)to find which commands/scripts that are executed by the cron daemon
	we find that there's a script inside it , we check the content of the script
	we find the name of a file in /tmp we cat the content of the file
	we find the password!
