*little note about ro13 cipher/ecryption:
	ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it

	A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|L|M
	^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
	| | | | | | | | | | | |
    v v v v v v v v v v v v
	N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|Y|Z

*solution 1:
	we can use vim rot13 builtin encoding that can be easily found by entering "help rot13" in the command mode
	(g?{motion}		Rot13 encode {motion} text. {not in Vi}) so we can easily encode/decode a line in vim using the rot 13
	by hitting g??
*solution 2:
	using the tr command (the transliteration utility(turning given characters into other ones)) to substute every character by the 13th character after it like this:
	tr "A-Ma-mN-Zn-z" "N-Zn-zA-Ma-m"
