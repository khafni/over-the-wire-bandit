*my solution:
	in the subject we are told that the setuid binary makes a connection to
	the localhost on a port we can specify as the binary(execitable)  argument
	it then reads a line of text from the connection and compraes it to the password
	of the previous level, that connection can be established using nc (netcut)
	so we start an nc server and echo to it the password so anyone who get connected
	to the server will get the password , like this :
		echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l localhost -p 42945
	then we can give the executable the port that we are listening to using the nc server
	like this :
		./suconnect 42945
*extra notes:
	we use tmux to split the terminal and do both tasks at the same time.
	sometimes when we specify a port it won't work since maybe it's used by the bandit20 ssh server
*password for level21:
