*my solution:
	here we can simply use the command diff to find the difference between passwords.old
	and password.new like this: 
		diff passwords.old passwords.new
	and the output will be:
		42c42
		< hlbSBPAWJmL6WFDb06gpTx1pPButblOA
		---
		> kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
	which means lines 42 of the passwords.old  needs to change to match line 42 of
	passwords.new
