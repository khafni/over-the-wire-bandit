*my solution:
	here i will explain more of the general method because the boring detailed solution isn't
	the essense of the exercice, here we have a file that is compressed/archived over and over in with
	different formats and we need to use different commands to unarchive/uncompress the file over and over
	untill we find a text file that contains the password.
	to do that we need to follow the steps:
		1.use the "file" command on the file every time to know its format if the file isn't a hexdump is it 
		is a hexdump use the xxd command with -r option to return the file to its original form from the hex 
		dump to an ASCII form.
		2. when the format of the compression/archiving is found we need to use the mv command to rename the file
		so it ends with the a file extension that corresponds to its format 
		3. we use a command that corresponds with the file format to uncompress/unarchive the file
	+the command that we can use to return a hexdump to its ASCII/binary format:
		xxd -r
	+commands for uncompression/unarchiving:
		-file format: .gz	-command to unarchive/uncompress it: gzip -d
		-file format: .bz2	-command to unarchive/uncompress it: bzip2 -d
		-file format: .tar	-command to unarchive/uncompress it: tar -xvf 
	+note about the "tar" command:
		x: Extract Mode
		v: verbose output (prints a line for each unarchived file. Not needed, but I prefer seeing it. It reassures
		me that the command worked properly.
		f: (In Extract Mode) Read from the given archive file ,If you omit this, tar just reads from STDIN.
