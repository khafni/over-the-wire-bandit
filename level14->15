*my solution:
    in the subject we are told to submit the password of the current level to port
    30000 on local host.
    this means we need to send a TCP data packet to the localhost server on port
    30000 , and this can be done using the nc (netcut) command like this:
    echo "4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e" | nc localhost 30000
