the solution is:
	strings data.txt | grep ===== | tail -1 | sed 's/=//g' | tr -d " "
explination:
	i needed a way to get the strings of printable characters in the file so i used the command "strings"
	to achieve that then i pipped its output to grep ==== to get the strings that start with multiple '=' characters
	now i could see few lines inlcuding the one that contains the password and that's maybe enough to solve the problem
	but it's not good enough for me so i pipped everything to tail -1 to print the last line only then i pipped its output
	to sed 's/=//g' to get rid of the '=' characters at the beggining and pipped the output to tr -d " " to get rid of
	the space at the beggining
