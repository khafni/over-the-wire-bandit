*my solution:
	here i will use another git concept which is git tags, that if compared to git commits , 
	and if we consider commits as history of our branches then tags are bookmarks for our branches
	but here we only need to list our current branch tags using "git tag" then use git show
	to see the content of the tag 
	steps:
		1)git tag 
		2)git show secret
